From the age of 4, I had dedicated my life to the Hawaii Japanese School, also known as Rainbow Gakuen (translates to "rainbow school"). Students met weekly on Saturdays from 8:30am - 3:30pm to learn numerous curriculums ranging from grades K-8 using textbooks and workbooks approved by the Ministry of Education in Japan. 

Classes contained of six blocks broken up to learn history and culture, reading, writing, all in Japanese. Students were never really allowed to speak any language besides Japanese. Throughout this, once we hit a certain level of reading and writing, weekly 'kanji test(s)' as well as quarterly midterm and final examinations were given. These tests determined whether we could pass and move onto the next grade level or not, so my Fridays consisted of all-nighters where I was *efficienty* cramming to get my workbook homework done and studying for the kanji test that happened the following morning. Nonetheless, students were required to read the textbook out loud in class and annotate beforehand. This upskilled my social anxiety that I faced.

Besides the frightening details on how rigorous weekly Japanese school was, I also formed forever friendships. My classmates and I still talk about the severe testing and stress we faced back then to this day, but truthfully it was the best and biggest project of my life. I learned the importance of language learning, as well as a whole new language, and what I am capable of. レインボー学園、ありがとうございました。(translates to "thank you Rainbow Gakuen)
