At the age of one, I left my hometown in Tokyo to move to Hawaiʻi. It felt like a leap into the unknown, where the language and culture were entirely foreign to me; I did not know where I belonged. I recall vividly those days in preschool, head down and tears streaming down my cheeks as I sat alone at the corner of the table during snack time, surrounded by laughter that I could not comprehend. Despite my naturally outgoing personality that I had in Japan, the inability to express myself left me to be isolated, as if I were in silent detention.

Yet, after a while of crying and begging to return to Japan, I gradually accepted my new life. I discovered the power of being bilingual and began to involve myself in school activities, finding a place for myself. Through these engagements, I found my gateway to connection and community within my new home, Hawaiʻi.

As I delve deeper into school life, I seized every opportunity to participate, eventually earning a place on the class council. Little did I know, this was just the beginning of my journey towards greater involvement and impact.

Before long, I found myself presented with a remarkable opportunity--to join the Kalani Association of Students (KAS), the main study body council that represented the entirety of my high school. It was a moment of pride and responsibility, and a chance to represent not just myself, but younger me that thought that I never stood a chance.

## Leadership Responsibilites

When I first joined KAS, I quickly recognized the dedication required for the role. We were tasked with planning, budgeting, participating, and beyond in every school event, demanding a lot of time and effort to communicate with students and faculty. 

I spent my first year in KAS as a Student Community Council Representative where I attended meetings and was entrusted with the responsibility of representing the interests and concerns of my peers to the school administration. Progressing to the next year, I was appointed a Secretary position where I maintained meeting data and organized future tasks for the council. I took on additional responsibilities managing social media and analyzing the accounts for improvement in order to ensure satisfaction of students. 

In my final year of high school, I was elected as the student body President. This pivotal leadership role tasked me with the responsibility of overseeing all tasks to be done in a timely manner, as well as ensuring the well-being of my council and other governing bodies. Besides, I had organized school-wide events, spirit weeks, student community service, and worked relentlessly to create an inclusive and vibrant high school experience for everyone.

## The Pathway to Presidency

My pathway from being a one year old newcomer to Hawai'i, grappling language barriers, has transformed into a narrative of growth and leadership. Joining the class council in high school created a turning point in my life where I unlocked opportunities and a new sense of self, ultimately leading to my role within the Kalani Association of Students.

My experience in KAS revealed the depth of dedication required for impactful student leadership. Across various positions, I endeavored to foster an enjoyable and safe high school environment. My journey underscores the transformative power of confronting life's challenges, reinforcing the idea that personal growth is an ongoing journey.
