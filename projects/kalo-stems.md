For my final project in ICS 314: Software Engineering, my team and I collaborated to develop a website application designed to enhance career connections and opportunities for University of Hawai ªi students. This platform is highly similar to LinkedIn but with a focus on inclusivity, allowing students and companies to create detailed profiles. Students are able to showcase their skills and awards, linking to their LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, while companies can efficiently find suitable candidates for their job opportunities. Our goal was to create a seamless and empowering experience for students to explore and pursue career paths within our university community.

## Key Responsibilites

I played a crucial role in design and development of the student profile management system, focusing on the creation and editing functionalities. This involved designing user-friendly interfaces and implementing robust backend logic to ensure seamless profile management for students.
