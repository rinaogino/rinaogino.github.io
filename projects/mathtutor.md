When COVID-19 happened, almost all schools were shut down and students were forced to meet virtually. Many students were lacking skills in learning, socializing, and motivation to do anything. It was a disaster. I then thought to myself, what can I do that can possibly be a help to anyone while keeping myself mentally active. This was when one of my high school counselors reached out to me and offered me a volunteering opportunity of tutoring students in need. As I have always found myself excelling in mathematics, I took part in tutoring one particular student who seemed to be falling behind in their classes especially with the impact of the pandemic.

As I got to know the student, this allowed me time to reflect on what I have learnt as well as strengthen my mentoring and social skills. We had met 2 to 3 times a week, sessions depending on the amount of work they wanted to complete. I had implemented creative and interactive teaching methods to make mathematical concepts more accessible and enjoyable for the student. As I monitored my student's progress, I started to see positive results in which the student's grades exceed! 

This experience will forever be a guidance toward my future as I now have learned on how I can take part as someone's mentor and that it is not just about the mathematical formulas or how to solve them. Witnessing the transformation from struggling with mathematical concepts to gaining confidence was a gratifying experience that highlighted the impact of my fostering in academic success.
