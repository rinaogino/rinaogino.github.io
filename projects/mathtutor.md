When COVID-19 happened, almost all schools were shut down and students were forced to meet virtually. Many students faced challenges in adapting to a new environment, and started to lack skills in learning, socializing, and motivation to do anything. I then thought to myself, what can I do that can possibly be a help to anyone while keeping myself mentally active as well. This was when one of my high school counselors reached out to me and offered me a volunteering opportunity of tutoring students in need. 

As I have always found myself excelling in mathematics, I took part in tutoring one particular student who was struggling in their classes especially with the impact of the pandemic. While getting to know the student, this also allowed me time to reflect on what I have learnt so far and enhancing my mentoring and social skills. We had met 2 to 3 times a week, sessions depending on the amount of work they wanted to complete. I had implemented creative and interactive teaching methods to make mathematical concepts more accessible and enjoyable for the student. Through consistent effort and tailored guidance, I started to see positive improvement in the student's grades--highlighting the positive impact of my mentoring on their academic success.

This experience has shaped my understanding of mentorship as I now have learned on how I can take part as someone's academic growth and not just about the mathematical formulas or how to solve them. Witnessing the transformation from struggling with mathematical concepts to gaining confidence was an experience that highlighted new dedication and collaboration skillsets.
