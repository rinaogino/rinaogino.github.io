### I. Introduction

By now, there are approximately 180.5 million users of ChatGPT, which certainly proves the enormous influence of artificial intelligence (AI) in this world. Ever since I was introduced to AI, I have somehow implemented this tool into my courses of study, particularly in ICS 314: Software Engineering. From simple grammar and syntax corrections, AI has the ability to assist in writing essays and code, whilst providing efficient and secure solutions. As AI has become a part of modern education, I am starting to see many of professors allow the use of it, expanding resources.

In software engineering, ChatGPT or Co-Pilot have been used to fix bugs, choosing which function/class to use, and overall to understand code. ChatGPT can also be used generally in every day tasks such as finding a dinner recipe, or finding an outfit to wear. AI has definitely revolutionized the way students learn, how schools or teachers facilitate, and or completing life tasks and people are starting to depend on it.

However, can AI really give us all the answers? No, not really. AI may be useful in many perspectives, but it cannot be fully depended on. As useful as it is, AI is still a tool and lacks several aspects. Nonetheless, here are some experiences I have had with AI below.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
<br>
In the past 63 experience WODs, I did not utilize AI. Most of the experiences included video explanations of step-by-step instructions on completing the assignments, and I felt that it was better to follow those resources instead of depending on AI to understand the material. As a visual learner, it was helpful to see the Professors' live recordings so that I can follow along and detect any mistakes that I have made. In [E18](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s24/morea/javascript-3/experience-underscore.html), I took my first step into functional programming utilizing Underscore.JS. I had no idea what Underscore.JS really was, but I found the given resources to be more than enough, and going over each instruction allowed me to prepare for the timed in-class WODs which I usually stressed about.

  2. In-class Practice WODs
<br>
In-class practice WODs were completed in groups of randomly chosen classmates, so it was interesting to see others' different approaches toward solving coding problems. In this case, I used ChatGPT when I was not able to my classmates' approaches or the prompt itself. I would ask, for example, "How can I approach the following issue using Underscore.JS: ... " and ChatGPT would list out what I must do along with an example snippet code. I then would compare what ChatGPT gave me with what my group came up with, and find a overall solution.

  3.  In-class WODs
<br>
With the pressure of having to clear each WOD and receive a 100% score (WODs were based on "all or nothing" scoring system), I used AI for majority of the in-class WODs. If I were stuck on a specific step during the WOD, I knew that I did not have enough time to look it up, so I would ask ChatGPT to summarize what I needed to do in order to successfully complete the WOD (I would use a similar question as the in-class practice WODs mentioned above). Additionally, at the very end of each WOD, to ensure that my code would run without any errors, I would input my entire code to ChatGPT and confirm before stressing myself out by seeing warnings in the output console. 
<br>
  4. Essays
<br>
I am not much of a creative writer nor have perfect grammar, so I utilized AI in many of my essays. I used ChatGPT to ask for a template of what I can write, and in which order for the essay to sound as engaging as possible. I would write out the essay myself then input it into ChatGPT, to make sure that it somehow followed the template while checking if it looked and sounded professional. I understand that essays are more-so creative writing in our own words, and AI may take away that by re-stating the essay itself in not so human-like words, but I liked the immediate feedback--that I believe helped me greatly in making my essays sound more engaging.
<br>
  5. Final project
<br>
For my final project, I wanted to mostly use my knowledge and skills developed from ICS 314. Therefore, I tried to minimize the use of AI but I did utilize it. 
<br>
  6. Learning a concept / tutorial

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
<br>
Without the use of AI, I used my own knowledge to answer a question in class or in Discord. If I was unable to explain a prompt myself, I would not answer another in the first place since I do not want to give anyone mistaken information. 
<br>
  8. Asking or answering a smart-question
<br>
I did not use AI to ask or answer a smart-question. If I were asking a smart-question, I would prefer to address the issue in my own words so that nothing is made up or changed, and that I could understand my issue later on if it is solved by another. Similarly, if I were looking for an answer for a smart-question, I would prefer for the answer to be described in human-like, easy terms so I did not use AI to answer any questions. To add on, whenever answering particular questions including errors, I like to include my own experiences of performing the task toward succession and writing a response in my own words helped me achieve this best.

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

  10. Explaining code

  11. Writing code

  12. Documenting code

  13. Quality assurance 

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above
