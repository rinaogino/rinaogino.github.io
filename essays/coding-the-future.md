## How did I get here?

I was never certain of what I wanted to do after I graduated high school, but I was always curious and interested in many things. From wanting to be a nurse, news reporter, pilot, and more, I enrolled as business management at UH Manoa. With my college credits that I took in high school, I was offered to join a direct admit program for the Shidler College of Business. All was going well until I one day thought to myself, "This is going great, but is this really enough?" 

During a road trip from Nevada to Utah to Arizona, a conversation came up between my uncle and I about the growth of informational technology. This initially lit something inside me, and two weeks before my first day at UH Manoa, I decided to take on a challenge to transition to become a BS Computer Science student.

## Journey with Coding with Heart

My passion for software engineering has been ignited by the uniqueness of programming, but also from the day I ran my first "Hello World" code. I was completely new to coding, and the sense of pride I felt when showcasing my newfound skill to my parents is something I will never forget. As I took on more assignments and engaged in larger in-class projects, I found myself eagerly sharing my coding achievements with friends and grandparents as well. The dynamic intersection of innovation and problem solving to create solutions toward numerous challenges excited me. Not only the functional requirements of software development, but the style of design and execution being completely customizable added an additional excitement.

Furthermore, I am enthusiastic about the upcoming challenges in software engineering. Whether through internships, projects, or meeting new peers and mentors, I aim to gain insights and skills beyond my software engineering course (that I am now enrolled in). I aspire to enhance my proficiency in programming languages and develop expertise in being able to solve and debug code efficiently. 

With the dynamic growth of the computer science field, my aspirations extend towards expanding my expertise in data science and artificial intelligence. I have always had an interest in databases and with the use of artificial intelligence and cloud computing, my goal is to conduct research on the impact of conversational AI on shaping our future.
