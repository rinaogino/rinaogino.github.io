When initially diving into the realm of programming, I have this feeling of anxiety and stress crawling up my spine. It's supposed to be a fun experience of learning something new, but it feels overwhelming to me. Born as a perfectionist, I get dismotivated easily if I don't get it on the first few tries. Hence, computer science has been a pretty humbling experience for myself, yet, it is also addicting because of the accomplishing feeling when my code runs successfully. I always have a on-and-off relationship with programming, but that was my journey that led me here, as I now take on another challenge with JavaScript.

## Getting Comfortable

With previous experience in dynamic programming languages, I now navigate the zone of getting comfortable with writing functions in JavaScript--I find them to be simpler compared to my first language, Java. Java is a much more complex language, where I would have to type out `public static void main (String[] args)` per every new method whereas JavaScript would simply require the syntax,`function NAME (parameters)`
The similarity in being able to print to the console such as `System.out.println` in Java and `console.log()` in JavaScript has also allowed me to get used to JavaScript quickly.

Per conditional statements such as if statements and switch statements, they are also similarly striking. This is where I realized that the syntaxes of both Java and JavaScript are almost the same. And... I was right. Java and JavaScript stem from C and C++, which I also previously enjoyed learning, as they inherit both rules and synatx from them. Hence, Java and such have what I see as 'add-ons', since it is a object-oriented language with classes that make it a bit easier to learn (especially for beginners).

## The Pushing Point

While finding similarities between past programming languages I have learnt and starting to get comfortable with JavaScript, I acknowledge that I am still taking my first steps in to programming. Having **W**orkout **O**f the **D**ay(s) (WODs) in my current software engineering course presents a difficult obstacle where I am required to solve certain prompts given a short amount of time with an all or nothing scoring system. 

I often find myself to take more time than others to grasp concepts, and fast paced courses like software engineering tend to terrify me. Still yet, I view that this will be my pushing point and a chance for myself to grow and become a better programmer. As stressful as it is, I want to do my best and hope to find enjoyment thoughout the process.

## Close to the Finish Line

As I take on this new adventure, I look forward to grasping every opportunity that comes my way to master JavaScript. With overcoming my anxiety inducing feelings, I am excited to see the challenges I overcome and learn why JavaScript is such a highly efficient programming language, that I will one day become a master of.
