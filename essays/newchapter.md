When initially delving into the realm of programming, you have this feeling of anxiety and stress crawling up your spine. It’s like when your Professor springs a coding quiz on the very first day of a beginner's Computer Science course. Well, that scenario became true in my freshman year of college when I had absolutely no prior experience or knowledge in programming. However, the feeling of accomplishment was extraordinary when I first ran my initial one line of code in Java despite the 15 minutes it took me to write out. That was the start of my journey here, now I take on another challenge with that spine-crawling feeling once again to learn a new programming language: JavaScript.

## Getting Comfortable

As of now, I am navigating the zone of getting comfortable with writing functions--I find them to be simpler compared to my first programming language, Java. Java is a much more complex language, where I would have to type out “public static void main (String[] args)” per every new method whereas JavaScript would simply require the syntax, “function NAME (parameters).” Furthermore, the similarity in being able to print to the console such as “System.out.println” in Java and “console.log()” in JavaScript has allowed me to get used to JavaScript.

Per conditional statements such as if statements and switch statements, they are also similarly striking. This is where I realized that the syntaxes of both Java and JavaScript are almost the same! Java and JavaScript syntaxes stem from the C programming language, which I also previously enjoyed learning, as well as C++.

## But... The Pushing Point

While finding similarities between past programming languages I have learnt and starting to get comfortable with JavaScript, I acknowledge that I am still taking my first steps in to programming. Having **W**orkout **O**f the **D**ay(s) (WODs) in ICS 314 (Software Engineering course) present a difficult obstacle where I am required to solve certain prompts given a short amount of time. As a learner, I often find myself to take more time than others to grasp concepts, and fast paced courses like these tend to terrify me. Still yet, I view that this will be my pushing point and a chance for myself to grow and become a better programmer and a better student overall. As stressful as it is, I want to do my best and hope to find enjoyment thoughout the process.

## Closing the Script

As I take on this new adventure, I look forward to seizing every opportunity that comes my way to master JavaScript. With overcoming my feeble feelings, I am excited to see the challenges I overcome and learn why JavaScript is such a highly efficient programming language that my Professor and peers often speak of.
