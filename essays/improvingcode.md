## Who makes the rules?

A government creates and enforces the rules of a society, maintains order, and provides assistance to the citizens. Similarly, coding standards are adhered by programmers to develop, execute, and share advanced successful code. Hence, I think of coding standards as the "Government of Code." 

# What are coding standards to begin with?

Coding standards are rules or conventions that order how code should be written in a programming language. They are for consistency, readability, and portability of code across projects and development amongs a team. Coding standards typically cover various aspects of practices, including of format/alignment, documentation, error and exception handling, and more. In order to disperse code for another to see or use, we must have a specific standard for the code to execute properly on the other end, and that is why coding standards are a must, just like our government (without a government, citizens would be free to do whatever they want--whether good or bad--and we would probably not want that). Besides, coding standards have the ability to improve one in learning a programming language just like the way we can become a "better" person if we follow governmental rules.

## ESLint makes the rules

As a learning programmer in JavaScript, one tool that I have been utilizing to find and fix problems is ESLint in IntelliJ IDEA. ESLint shows up as a green checkmark or red error mark depending on what it detects from analyzing the code that you write. In my experience, when I first installed it into the developer environment, I had typed in an example code and that was the moment where I absolutely got humbled and judged with red error lines across my screen. As a person with a detail-oriented personality, it was surprising (and annoying) to see them, I immediately fixed what it told me to do for the satisfactory of the green checkmark.

## The foolproof way to get ignored.

While there are decent questions that benefit everyone, there are those one can ask to create an entirely different effect. In the following example, a user asks how he would, in short, create a desktop application with Facebook.

```
Q: Facebook Desktop Notifier

I am a beginner programmer that have never used anything other than what's included in a language.

I am trying to create a desktop application that notifies me anytime I get an update onfacebook. 
How should go about doing this? Thanks in advance.

edit Sorry I was not clear. Is there any way to make a DESKTOP application with facebook?
```

A simple “yes” would have answered the question, but we know that’s not the sort of answer he or she is looking for. Fortunately, someone kindly responded with a link to Facebook’s developer website. The asker should have done more research on his or her potential project. Then further down the road, he or she could have asked more specific and detailed questions that wouldn’t require a thousand-paged response for a sufficient answer.

## Conclusion

When we rely on others’ generosity and expertise to provide answers to our questions, it should hold that the question we ask should be one that leads to efficient and effective help that not only benefits us, but also the people we ask and others who might ask the same question in the future. Thus, if you have a question… make it a smart one! Asking questions may not always get you the best answer, but asking them in a way that will make others want to answer them will increase the success of finding a good solution and make it a positive experience on all sides.
