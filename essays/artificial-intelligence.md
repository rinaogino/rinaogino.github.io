### I. Introduction

By now, there are approximately 180.5 million users of ChatGPT, which certainly proves the enormous influence of artificial intelligence (AI) in this world. Ever since my friend from univeristy introduced me to this tool, I have somehow implemented it into majority of my courses, especially in ICS 314: Software Engineering. From simple grammar and syntax corrections, AI has the ability to write essays and code in seconds, providing efficient and secure solutions.

As AI has become a part of modern education, many schools are starting to utilize it and it has revolutionized the way students learn as well as how schools or teachers facilitate. In ICS 314, ChatGPT or Co-Pilot may have been used to fix any bugs and to choose which function/class to use for successful code output (e.g. picking out Underscore functionality). In general, AI can be used toward almost anything including finding the right baking recipe to an color analysis of one self. 

So, is AI going to take over the world? No, not necessarily. AI may be useful in many perspectives, but it cannot be fully depended on. Though I believe it will be much more utilized in the future, especially in software engineering.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18

In the 63 experience WODs, I did not utilize AI. Most of the experiences included video explanations of step-by-step instructions on completing the assignments, and I felt that it was better to follow those resources instead of depending on AI to understand the material. As a visual learner, it was helpful to see what the Professors were doing throughout the videos so that I can follow along and detect any mistakes that I have made. Particularly in E18, we learnt about functional programming utilizing Underscore.JS and each instruction allowed me to prepare for the timed in-class WODs which I stressed about weekly.

  2. In-class Practice WODs

In-class practice WODs were completed in groups of randomly chosen classmates, so it was interesting to see different approaches toward solving problems using code. Here, I used ChatGPT when I was not able to understand the prompt or others' opinions and asked for example, "How can I approach the following issue using Underscore.JS: ... "

  3. In-class WODs



  4. Essays

  5. Final project

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

  10. Explaining code

  11. Writing code

  12. Documenting code

  13. Quality assurance 

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above


### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:


### IV. Practical Applications:


### V. Challenges and Opportunities:


### VI. Comparative Analysis:


### VII. Future Considerations:


### VIII. Conclusion:

I believe AI will continue to advance, and I am curious as to how it will impact software development in 10 years from now.
